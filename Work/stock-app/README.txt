Welcome!

My name is Auntiewhnor Kpolie. I forked this repo to learn more about python and working
with files. I consider myself a lifelong learner. Please let me know about errors or
improvements I could make!

Use `print-report.py` or `print-cost.py` to give a portfolio table or total portfolio cost on the command line (Windows). This avoids the `python -m` command.

Example: C:\Users\stock-app> python print-report.py portfolio.csv prices.csv txt
